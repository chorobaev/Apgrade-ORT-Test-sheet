# Background

GRT is a key to go an university in Kyrgyzstan. But there is not 
enough sources to prepare for it. Especially it is  very difficult to have trial 
GRT test. This problem can be solved by using an availability of 
smartphones and the Internet.

# Aim of the project

Aim of this project is to give high school students opportunities to try GRT 
anywhere and any time. Only requirements are android smartphone and 
Internet connection.

# Objectives of the project

High school students from villages have to go to a nearby city or even Bishkek and
Osh to have trial GRT. It is very expensive in terms of finance and time. 
Even they go such centers, they can wait a few days to have it. Because 
trial GRT centers are usually very busy. **Apgrade ORT Test-Sheet** can solve this problem 
and give to students opportunities to try it cheap and easily.
